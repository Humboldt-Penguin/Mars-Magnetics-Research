## Important Information

**Summary:** Since December 2021, I've been analyzing the magnetization of Mars's crust around impact-craters to (1) constrain the direction/lifetime of Mars's internal magnetic field, and (2) determine the depth of magnetization in the crust. 

**Acknowledgements:** I'd like to express gratitude to my primary advisor, Professor [Lujendra Ojha](http://www.lujendraojha.com/), for guiding me throughout this project. 

**Recognition:**

* In Summer 2022, I was awarded a fellowship grant by the NASA New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.
* In December 2022, I will be giving an oral presentation at the American Geophysical Union's Fall 2022 conference. Abstract citation pending.
