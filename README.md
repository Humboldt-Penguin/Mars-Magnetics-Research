Since December 2021, I've been analyzing (1) the history of the Martian dynamo and (2) formation time/depth of crustal magnetic sources via impact craters.

I'd like to express gratitude to my primary advisor, Professor [Lujendra Ojha](http://www.lujendraojha.com/), for guiding me throughout this project.
