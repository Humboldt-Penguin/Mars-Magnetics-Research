# --IN SHORT--

Our work is the first to systematically search all medium-size Martian craters (>70 km diameter) for crustal magnetization signatures using high-resolution MAVEN magnetometer data. Our two main conclusions are:

1. The rarity of demagnetization implies magnetic sources are deeply buried, suggesting that magnetization formed at the same time as primordial crust.
2. The demagnetization of Henry crater strongly suggests the dynamo ceased by 3.6 Ga.

But on that second point, why is such a small crater (167 km diameter) one of the *MOST* demagnetized (non-major) craters on Mars? Our new focus is on investigating the causal factors of impact-induced demagnetization, which could help us constrain:

* Crustal formation mechanisms,
* Early basal heating / heat flow rates,
* Threshold demagnetization pressures/temperatures,
* Crustal thickness/density quantities,
* GRS elemental concentration uncertainties, etc.

Couldn't have done it without my advisor [Lujendra Ojha](http://www.lujendraojha.com/) -- check out his music about the adventures of the time-traveling, crime-fighting squirrel, [Captain Henry](http://www.lujendraojha.com/gallery)!
