Description of subfolders:

`1_raw/`
	- Raw data from external sources such as satellites with minimal modifications.
	- Modules such as `GRS.py` have functions to download data into here from Google Drive when they are run. Thus it is safe to delete these data after they are no longer in use.
	
`2_interim/`
	- Temporary/miscellanous data produced in the process of running code.
	
`3_final
	- Final data/plots.
